# Islandora FindingAids Batch [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ulsdevteam/islandora_findingaid_batch.png?branch=7.x)](https://travis-ci.org/ulsdevteam/islandora_findingaid_batch)

## Introduction

This module implements a batch framework for importing finding aids into Islandora.

The ingest is a two-step process:

* Preprocessing: The data is scanned and a number of entries are created in the
  Drupal database.  There is minimal processing done at this point, so preprocessing can
  be completed outside of a batch process.
* Ingest: The data is actually processed and ingested. This happens inside of
  a Drupal batch.
